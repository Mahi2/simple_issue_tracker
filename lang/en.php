A simple Issue tracker based on the MoSCoW</strong><br><br><br><br>> method.
It is a tracking tool focused on a single developer.
It has a modern user interface making the user experience very fluid.
It is designed to work without database, on cheap web space or 100% offline web space, for example on localhost, so it is very fast.
Using it should be as simple as copying the script code.
To run, simply edit the configuration and start the index file.
